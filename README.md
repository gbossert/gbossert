# **Hi, I‚Äôm Georges**

I‚Äôm so glad you are here and I'm looking forward to getting to know you! 

This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we could collaborate together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

# My role as a CTPO at Sekoia

Chief Technical & Product Officer (CTPO) owns and is accountable for both the product strategy and the technical strategy. Hence, I ensure that **our products are built fast, with strong technology, and real user impact**.

I like to summarize my role under the following three key statements:

1. I am here to make sure our R&D teams are both successful and happy: I want *Sekoians* to improve their technical skills, grow their career, enjoy their work, and believe in both their team's and our company's mission.
2. I am here to make sure our company is successful and pointed in the right direction. I am here to make sure our R&D teams are all aligned and pushing in the same direction, the company‚Äôs direction.
3. I am here to make sure our teams are getting what we need from other departments, and that other departments are getting what they need from us; I'm also here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.

I write some code and contribute actively to the roadmap definition too! 

üß≠ In addition to my role as CTPO, I‚Äôm part of the **Executive Team** and have a **seat on Sekoia‚Äôs board** as **co-founder**, where I help shape the company‚Äôs overall strategy and direction.

# My Cadence

I firmly believe that handling tasks properly and efficiently will lead to success IF it‚Äôs done fast enough. On top of this, I‚Äôve accepted since my younger years that I‚Äôm not among the particularly smart people. 

Hence, the only solution I found to reach success is hard work and dedication. 

I usually work in the evening and on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect you to work during weekends, instead be smart.** I might Mattermost or emails you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you.

You can Mattermost me 24 hours a day. It‚Äôs my preferred communication medium. I like responding quickly.

I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

# My North Stars Principles

## Velocity is King

**I firmly believe that winners are those who move quickly.** Speed is crucial‚Äînot just for its own sake, but because momentum builds over time. I always do my best to challenge any unnecessary delays, blockers, or slow processes. If something is taking too long, I‚Äôll question why and seek ways to accelerate. I'm a proponent of launching, learning, and improving‚ÄîI prefer seeing something in action and iterated upon rather than caught in endless polishing cycles.

## **Transparency & Openness**

**I believe that information should be shared openly**, not withheld, as keeping it to oneself goes against my core values. I find it very difficult to remain silent when others assume what's useful for someone else: openness should be the default approach. I've worked in highly sensitive areas and understand when secrecy is necessary, but at Sekoia, I expect secrecy to be the exception, not the rule.

## We are all equal Humans

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** Most humans try to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity. Those in power have a disproportionate responsibility to invest in historically disadvantaged humans proactively.

# Nuances & Errata

üßê The biggest challenge for me is working with people who **say important things only once and expect full understanding immediately**. If I don‚Äôt catch the right signals in that first transmission, I may misinterpret the importance or even miss the point entirely. This can lead to situations where:

- you might assumes I understood something critical, but I didn‚Äôt process it the way you expected.
- your important priorities get lost because they weren‚Äôt framed in a way that triggers my urgency filter.

I‚Äôm actively trying to improve this situation. For example, I tend to **ask for more clarification proactively** and **focus deeper on catching implicit signals** even when they don‚Äôt match my usual processing patterns. That said, clear and structured communication will always work best with me!

üí°**When I give you a task that seems unclear**, please ask me for more details and determine its importance. I could still be in the brainstorming phase, and your questions can help save everyone a lot of time.

ü™ñ **I am heavily biased toward action.** Long meetings where we endlessly debate potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

‚úã**Use assertive asking rather than assertive telling** when you need my help. I'm more receptive to requests like "Georges, can you help with X?" than directives like "Georges, do X.". The latter usually hurts my self-confidence and it slows me to properly under the requests. I have been this way since I was a kid and probably need therapy.

üé° **I love beginning new projects**, but I often lose interest once I can mentally picture the outcome, which is usually before the project is actually finished. To overcome this, I partner with people who are excellent at managing tasks and following through to completion.

üòµ **I‚Äôm not English-native speaker**, my language skills sometimes limit my ability to convey subtle messages. I generally keep things straightforward, which some people might perceive as rude. 

üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **I get really triggered when people state their opinions as facts**. In these instances, I tend to jump into the conversation to make it clear that what they‚Äôre sharing is only their opinion, and not an actual fact.
